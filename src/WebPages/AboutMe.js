            deeply passionate about exploring the intersections of{" "}

            <span style={{ color: "#0469FF" }}>Quantum Computing</span>. My
            internship at the CRA has honed my development skills and fueled my
            curiosity. Outside the classroom, I indulge in video games and
            sports, finding them a great source of relaxation and a platform for
            building strategic thinking. Eager and dedicated, I'm excited to
            apply my knowledge to make meaningful contributions to technology
            and beyond.
