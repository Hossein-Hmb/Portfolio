          Growing up, I was always facinated by technology. I became curious on
          how video games are created, how websites are designed and how
          Augmented Reality works. And the answer behind all these questions is{" "}
          <span style={{ color: "#FF0000" }}>{wordCode()}</span>. Thatâ€™s when I
          realized that everything around us is{" "}
          <span style={{ color: "#FF0000" }}>{wordCode()}</span>. Whether it is
          swinging around Manhattan with your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man
          or searching your favorite restaurant on Google, its all thousands and
          thousands lines of{" "}
          <span style={{ color: "#FF0000" }}>{wordCode()}</span>.
